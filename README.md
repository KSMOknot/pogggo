# Pogggo - The modern music sharing application

## Backstory
For months now I've wanted to build an application that would allow me to quickly and easily share music with friends. My original idea was a website that would enable anyone to share their favorite tunes with a single link. 

I believed that receiving a single URL to a curated library of someone's favorite music would save everyone loads of time:

- Friends who share music can better organize their favorite music for sending.
- And those looking for new music suggestions can more easily discover great tunes.

Pogggo is a solution to the problem of sharing music in the age of robust streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal. Simply send your friends a link to your Pogggo library and they'll be able to see all your favorite tunes organized and ready for your auditory pleasure.
